Hello! I’m Vivek, a [Computer Science + Linguistics](http://cs-ling.linguistics.illinois.edu/) major at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/). I’m passionate about using technology to impact society.

Currently, I work as a Data Engineering Intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/). My other activities include Member of Corporate Staff, [ACM@UIUC](https://acm.illinois.edu/) and Executive Course Assistant, [CS196@Illinois.](http://cs196.xyz/) You can find my resume [here](https://vivekvaidya.me/Resume.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/vivekvaidya) and (occasionally) messing around on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thevivekvaidya?lang=en). I also like traveling, photography, and eating food.

While most of my social media links are on the left, the best way to get in touch with me is vivekvaidya [at] outlook [dot] com. Thanks for stopping by!
